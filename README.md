## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x or newer //todo
- pip (Python package installer)
- gcloud sdk

### Installing Google Cloud CLI

Before you start, you need to install the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud CLI), which is essential for managing resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

#### Quick Installation Guide

1. **Download and Install:**

   - Visit the [Google Cloud SDK page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) for download links and installation instructions specific to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

   - After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run `gcloud init` to authenticate and set up your default project configuration.

For detailed installation steps and troubleshooting, refer to the [official Google Cloud SDK documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/).

#### Verifying Installation

Check the installation by running `gcloud version` in your command prompt or terminal. This command should display the installed version of the gcloud CLI.
